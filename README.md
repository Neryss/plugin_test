Plugin test 1.17

## Informations
First of all, this is a plugin for Minecraft 1.17. I use it to test some features that I'd like to add in a finish product.
The plguin actually works and implements the following commands to the game (you can also find them in the [plugin.yml](src/plugin.yml)) :
```
- /boots : givesyou a pair of leaping boots
- /doctor : heals you through chat
- /launch : launch you into the air
- /starstaff : gives you a special staff with some great functionalities
```

Code might be ugly, keep in mind that I started working on this whtout any knowledge of java or minecraft coding system. It works just fine and I try to update it fairly often to get a clearer code and more feature.
