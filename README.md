# plugin_test
This is a test plugin for minecraft 1.17, it's a simple plugin that adds a few features. I use this plugin to learn about java and spigot usage.

# Features

The plugin adds the following commands (that you can find in the [plugin.yml](plugin_test/src/plugin.yml)) :
```
- /launch : propels yourself in the air
- /boots : gives you boots of leaping
- /doctor : heals you through the chat
- /skulls : gives your head or a desired player's one
- /starstaff : gives you a buffed trident
- /changeteam : change your current team with the gui (need to have an armor set equipped)
```

It also adds an item that has a chance to randomly drop from flowers in the wild : the Void Lily, which is a WIP teleporting item.

# Installation
Just drag and drop the plugin inside your server's plugin folder. You can find it in the release tab. Keep in mind it's a pre release for now!
You can give me any feedback through Discord (Neryss#0002) or mail.
